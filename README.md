manganiac
=========

Firstly, Manganiac it's a project that I developed to help myself with my monthly purchase of mangas, if you want to use, then you'll have to set up a node.js server and an instance of mongodb in your environment.

The second reason, it's that I had to learn some basics about integrate nodejs and mongodb with angularjs.

- NodeJS
- AngularJS
- Express
- Mongoose
- Jquery
- Bootstrap
- MongoDB

Setup
=======

- nodejs
  - port used: 1337
